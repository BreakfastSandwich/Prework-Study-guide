# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My main motivation was to gain a foundational knowledge of the virtual world around me. Through the developement process I learned the basics of how the use HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.

## Installation

Download the raw GIT file through GitHub using either a SSH key or through the HTTPS link. Once the file is pulled use your prefered IDE to launch the code on your local machine. For best results use a browser with developer tools. 

## Usage

To use the WebPage launch the code on your local browser, prefereably one with developer tools. Use the browser's inspect funtion to access the Console and interact with the JavaScript funtions.
